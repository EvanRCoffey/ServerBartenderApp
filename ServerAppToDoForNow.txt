NOW...

-Write code to make the second slider always be later than the first [Mills]

THEN...

* Once you finish all the above tasks, deploy

* Test/Debug online version

* Give to friends to start using.  Think of ways to get the word out other than just Facebook.
	-Make sure they have the sample login so they can see how the financial summary works
	-Write an email to everyone explaining how it works, plans for the future, etc

AT SOME POINT...

-Finish/polish the financial summary (instructions in financialSummaryTest.js) [Evan]

-Two different calendar outputs on jobEditor.handlebars [Mills]

-When a user deletes a job, this is what should happen:
	1) With an extra level of validation, make sure the user understands what they're doing
	2) Don't actually delete the DB entries.  Add a boolean "deletedByUser" to the job and shift models, and when a job is "deleted", just change that flag to true and cascade to include all shifts associated with that job, as well.  Add something to all job/shift queries along the lines of "{where: {deletedbyUser:false}}"
