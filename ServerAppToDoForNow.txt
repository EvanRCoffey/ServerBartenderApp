ASAP...

1) Finish shift-table-test verion of selecting shift to edit (Mills is on this)

Shifts Table:
Working as expected and extra lines are gone.
We need to change the location to be a resturant name.
This has to be linked to the job table in the db.
Once we get moment.js incorparated, it will be easy to fix the date format.
I need to move the search shifts by date to the bottom or top of this page.
I would hold off on applying this to the other sections for now so we don't have to change the
code in multiple spots.

Shifts Editor:
Amazing magical dropdown populating function created.
It takes the value of a hidden input field and sets the targeted dropdown accordingly.
I think i can use this method to set the slider positions as well.
Only thing left to do is dependant on getting the date/time converted to moment.js

The update button does not post to the route yet, but will be easy to setup once the moment stuff 
is in.

3) Once the shift-table-test is done and you get it working with shifts, apply it to jobs/restaurant, too

TESTING/DEBUGGING...

4) Test/Debug offline version
5) Deploy

-Make sure they have the sample login so they can see how the financial summary works
