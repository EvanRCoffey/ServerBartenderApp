EVAN

	---WHENEVER---

		-Start the timeline creator

		-When a user deletes a job, this is what should happen:
		  	1) With an extra level of validation, make sure the user understands what they're doing
		 	2) Don't actually delete the DB entries.  Add a boolean "deletedByUser" to the job and shift models, and when a job is "deleted", just change that flag to true and cascade to include all shifts associated with that job, as well.  Add something to all job/shift queries along the lines of "{where: {deletedByUser: false}}"
		
		-When a user deletes a menu, do the same as above, without cascading

	---NOT YET---

		-Once Mills finishes his updates to financial summary, finish/polish it the rest of the way
			-Debug thoroughly
			-Update the site and send the dummy account info to all users so they can look

		-Once Mills finishes the menu builder, build the quiz maker and flash card
			-Quiz maker already started: "./public/assets/javascript/quizMakerTesting.js"
