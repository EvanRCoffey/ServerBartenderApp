ASAP...

1) Finish shift-table-test verion of selecting shift to edit (Mills is on this)

Shifts Table:
Working as expected and extra lines are gone.
We need to change the location to be a resturant name.
This has to be linked to the job table in the db.
Once we get moment.js incorparated, it will be easy to fix the date format.
I need to move the search shifts by date to the bottom or top of this page.
I would hold off on applying this to the other sections for now so we don't have to change the
code in multiple spots.

Shifts Editor:
Amazing magical dropdown populating function created.
It takes the value of a hidden input field and sets the targeted dropdown accordingly.
I think i can use this method to set the slider positions as well.
Only thing left to do is dependant on getting the date/time converted to moment.js

The update button does not post to the route yet, but will be easy to setup once the moment stuff 
is in.

2) Get financial summary to display using jquery instead of in the console
3) Once Mills's shift-table-test is done and you get it working with shifts, apply EVERYTHING to jobs/restaurant
4) Debug to the best of your ability - test various things and make sure there are no glaring errors
5) Deploy
6) Test the online version to make sure everything works as expected
7) Give to friends to start using.  Think of ways to get the word out other than just Facebook.
-Make sure they have the sample login so they can see how the financial summary works

3) Notify users so they can log in to the sample account to see that, too
