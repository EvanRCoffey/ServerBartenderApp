TESTING/DEBUGGING...

"required" has been inserted into shift.handlebars and job.handlebars on the fields deemed necessary.
	-put "required" into shiftEdit and jobEdit in the same places
	-write "if" clauses for the other fields OR get "allowNull: true" to work

* Deploy

* Test/Debug online version (some of these can be done later)

	-Decide how to handle early A.M. out-times AND matching in- and out-times
		-We'll write code to make the second slider always be at least 15 minutes after the first.

	-Format TimeIn items on shift table and StartDate items on job table

	-Finish/polish the financial summary (instructions in financialSummaryTest.js)

* Give to friends to start using.  Think of ways to get the word out other than just Facebook.
	-Make sure they have the sample login so they can see how the financial summary works
	-Write an email to everyone explaining how it works, plans for the future, etc
