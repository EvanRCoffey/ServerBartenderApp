BY THE END OF THE WEEK...

1) Pull shifts for a user, listing them descending by date (Mills is on this)

2) Allow users to view/edit and delete jobs/shifts/restaurants. (Evan is on this)

-For now, can only do it the 'one entry on a given date' method.  That's enough to make sure they're all working, though.

3) Debug to the best of your ability - test various things and make sure there are no glaring errors

-Some things should be AJAX requests, and some should be http requests.  Find out which go where.

4) Deploy

5) Test the online version to make sure everything works as expected

6) Give to friends to start using.  Think of ways to get the word out other than just Facebook.



***Errors needing fixing
-Why are all of the DECIMAL values rounding off?

NEXT STEPS...

1) Insert enough fake shift data with one account to where you can start working on the financial summary (and timeline)

2) Get the financial summary up and working 

3) Allow anybody to log in to the sample account to see how it will look once more data is entered

4) Get the timeline up and working

5) Notify users so they can log in to the sample account to see that, too

See if Sarah can get a bunch of data for you since she's admin at Fleming's.  Make sure that's legal, first.

Decide on a name for the website (already thought of a few - see potentialSiteNames.txt)
