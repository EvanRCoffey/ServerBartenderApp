MILLS

	-Implement the design/UI pass
	-Debugging and presentation prep

EVAN

	***Finish the Flash Cards (see flashCards.js comments)

	***Finish the Timeline Creator (Prebuilt display using amcharts?  Some other prebuilt display?  Build something from scratch?)		

	***Users shouldn't delete shifts, jobs or menus.  They should "delete" them.
	  	1) Add an extra level of validation to each delete button.  On job deletion, also explain that its shifts will go, too.
	 	2) When something is "deleted", just change its "deletedByUser" flag to true.  (When a user "deletes" a job, be sure to cascade to include all of that job's shifts' "deletedByUser" flags, as well.)
	 	3) Add something to all job/shift/menu queries along the lines of "{where: {deletedByUser: false}}"

	-NEXT UPDATE:
		-Looks like all items are marked secret right now
		-When a user gets a question correct or incorrect, display the correct answer(s)
		-Prevent duplicate questions and duplicate answers (can wait, if necessary)
		-Create a job dropdown just like in shift creator to replace the hardcoded "1" in idObj
		-Change quiz answer buttons to checkboxes plus a submit button - ALL answers must match for a correct result, not just one [alternatively, you can just swap all "select all that apply" with "select any that apply"]
		-Update the site, update the dummy account, and send an email
