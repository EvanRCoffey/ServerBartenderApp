TESTING/DEBUGGING...

-Try to input fake/incorrect data on every field
	-Floats and ints can be too big to push to DB
	-Floats and ints can be submitted as a negative number
	-All dropdowns can be submitted without selecting something
	-Make certain fields mandatory before you can submit - decide which ones, match it with DB

-Make sure updating/deleting shifts/jobs is all happening as intended

-Decide how to handle early A.M. out-times AND matching in- and out-times

-When you add a new shift, you need to save the JobId.  You'll need to find the id of the job that's been selected.

-Finish/polish the financial summary

-Format TimeIn items on shift table and StartDate items on job table

-If you can make the site look better without spending much time on it, do so

-Make loginFailure more than just "404 page goes here"
