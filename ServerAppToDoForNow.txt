	-When a user deletes a job, this is what should happen:
	  	1) With an extra level of validation, make sure the user understands what they're doing
	 	2) Don't actually delete the DB entries.  Add a boolean "deletedByUser" to the job and shift models, and when a job is "deleted", just change that flag to true and cascade to include all shifts associated with that job, as well.  Add something to all job/shift queries along the lines of "{where: {deletedByUser: false}}"
		-When a user deletes a menu, do the same as above, without cascading

	-Once you chat with Mills about how the timeline should be laid out, continue building the timeline creator
