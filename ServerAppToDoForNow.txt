1) Finish shift-table-test verion of selecting shift to edit (Mills is on this)
2) Once Mills's shift-table-test is done and you get it working with shifts, apply EVERYTHING to jobs/restaurant
3) Debug to the best of your ability - test various things and make sure there are no glaring errors
4) Deploy
5) Test the online version to make sure everything works as expected
