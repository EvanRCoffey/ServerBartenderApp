	-Users shouldn't delete shifts, jobs or menus.  They should "delete" them.
	  	1) Add an extra level of validation to each delete button
	 	2) Add a boolean "deletedByUser" to the job, menu, and shift models
	 	3) When something is "deleted", just change its "deletedByUser" flag to true.  When a user "deletes" a job, be sure to explain that shifts will also be deleted, during validation, and also be sure to cascade to include all of that job's shifts. Add something to all job/shift/menu queries along the lines of "{where: {deletedByUser: false}}"
