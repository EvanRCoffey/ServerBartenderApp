	*Shift Management, Goal Management, Job Management
		1) Add an extra level of validation to each delete button.  On job deletion, also explain that its shifts will go, too.
	 	2) When something is "deleted", just change its "deletedByUser" flag to true.  (When a user "deletes" a job, be sure to cascade to include all of that job's shifts' "deletedByUser" flags, as well.)
	 	3) Add something to all job/shift/menu queries along the lines of "{where: {deletedByUser: false}}"
	 	(Shift edit only - slidebars are both defaulting to Noon)
