***PRE-PRESENTATION STUFF:

	-Fix the goal status tabs on the dashboard [Evan]
	-Add checkboxes and functionality for "selected categories" button on the flash card page [Evan]

	-Make them look like actual flash cards (look like a card - yes; animation - maybe) [Mills]
	*Navigation Bar: Decide how to organize all of the links [Mills]
	*Home Page: Simplify it, but don't let it just be a blank page [Mills]
	-Make PDFs/slides for presentation [Mills]



***POST-PRESENTATION STUFF

		*Dashboard, Home Page, Navigation Bar, Financial Summary, Timeline
			-See "pre-presentation stuff" above

		*Shift Management, Goal Management, Job Management
			1) Add an extra level of validation to each delete button.  On job deletion, also explain that its shifts will go, too.
		 	2) When something is "deleted", just change its "deletedByUser" flag to true.  (When a user "deletes" a job, be sure to cascade to include all of that job's shifts' "deletedByUser" flags, as well.)
		 	3) Add something to all job/shift/menu queries along the lines of "{where: {deletedByUser: false}}"
		 	(Shift edit only - slidebars are both defaulting to Noon)

		*Sign Up
			-Should we demand passwords be a certain length/complexity?

		*Feedback
			-Redirect to dashboard with a success message

		*Quiz Maker, cont...
			-"Start quiz maker" button not pulling job ID correctly.  It all seems to hinge on line 13 in quizMaker.js.
			-Change quiz answer buttons to checkboxes plus a submit button - ALL answers must match for a correct result, not just one
			-Looks like all items are marked secret right now in the menu builder
			-Prevent duplicate answers and duplicate questions

		*Flash Card, cont...
			-Entrees, sides, and desserts should include allergy violations, descriptors, and ingredients, too
			-Job/menu should be selected (just like with the quiz maker)
			-Give user option to shuffle cards or do them in order

		*Timeline, cont...
			-Mills said he'd take a look at amcharts and see if it'd be quick to implement.  If not, just make something from scratch.
