MILLS

-Colors/logos for the website
-Make spreadsheet for shift data

EVAN

-Finish/polish the financial summary
	-Once Mills makes the spreadsheet, input all of the fake shift data using a dummy account
	-Debug (you can start this process now, but having the spreadsheet would help a lot)
	-Once it's all working, ship it to Mills to make it look nice
	-Once it looks nice, update the site and send the dummy account info to all users

-Finish the goal checker
	-Finish debugging it
	-Edit each of the four goalStatus options, preferably each as modal popups
	-Get the goalStatus to update correctly
  
-When a user deletes a job, this is what should happen:
  	1) With an extra level of validation, make sure the user understands what they're doing
 	f2) Don't actually delete the DB entries.  Add a boolean "deletedByUser" to the job and shift models, and when a job is "deleted", just change that flag to true and cascade to include all shifts associated with that job, as well.  Add something to all job/shift queries along the lines of "{where: {deletedByUser: false}}"
