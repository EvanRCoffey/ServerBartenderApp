EVAN

	---WHENEVER---

		-Put a fake menu or two into the DB (put a route that creates a menu in menuJSON.js)

		-When a user deletes a job, this is what should happen:
		  	1) With an extra level of validation, make sure the user understands what they're doing
		 	2) Don't actually delete the DB entries.  Add a boolean "deletedByUser" to the job and shift models, and when a job is "deleted", just change that flag to true and cascade to include all shifts associated with that job, as well.  Add something to all job/shift queries along the lines of "{where: {deletedByUser: false}}"
			-When a user deletes a menu, do the same as above, without cascading

	---NOT YET---

		-Once Mills figures out how to get the dates from the sliders in the financial summary page
			-Finish debugging the financial summary (see .js file - only date stuff left, it seems)

		-Once Mills finishes the menu builder, build the quiz maker and flash card
			-Quiz maker already started: "./public/assets/javascript/quizMakerTesting.js"

		-Once you chat with Mills about how the timeline should be laid out, continue building the timeline creator
			-Queries built - all comments/breakthroughs and goals are being put into arrays/objects, ready for use
			-Prebuilt display using amcharts???
