BY THE END OF THE WEEK...


Soon, meet on slack to discuss database setups - think ahead!
Set up relationships too.


1) Password recovery via email (Mills)

2) Allow users to view/edit and delete jobs/shifts/restaurants. (Evan is on this)

-HTML updated for shift.html!
-Pseudocode entered into shift.js!
-Currently working through pseudocode and replacing it with real code

3) Envision the "new user" experience - make sure everything is intuitive

4) Create a basic financial data aggregation - average tip%, average $ per shift, etc (Evan is on this too - OK if incomplete)

5) Deploy

6) Give to friends to start using.  Think of ways to get the word out other than just Facebook.

***Errors needing fixing
-Why are all of the DECIMAL values rounding off?
-What's the deal with these friggin range slidebars?
-Why are the radio buttons not working correctly?
-You need a field for "Total Walked With" in the shift form

NEXT STEPS...

1) Insert enough fake shift data with one account to where you can start working on the financial summary (and timeline)

2) Get the financial summary up and working 

3) Allow anybody to log in to the sample account to see how it will look once more data is entered

4) Get the timeline up and working

5) Notify users so they can log in to the sample account to see that, too

See if Sarah can get a bunch of data for you since she's admin at Fleming's.  Make sure that's legal, first.

Decide on a name for the website (already thought of a few - see potentialSiteNames.txt)
