TESTING/DEBUGGING...

-Try to input fake/incorrect data on every field
	-Floats and ints can be too big to push to DB
	-Floats and ints can be submitted as a negative number
	-All dropdowns can be submitted without selecting something
	-Make certain fields mandatory before you can submit - decide which ones, match it with DB

-Make sure updating/deleting shifts/jobs is all happening as intended

-Change the "select the same date if you're still working here" on the job form to "leave blank if you're still there"
	-Add a boolean to the db, stillWorkingHere
	-If endDate === NULL, stillWorkingHere = true

-Decide how to handle early A.M. out-times AND matching in- and out-times

-Look at your models to make sure there aren't any duplicated/unnecessary fields

-Remove "shiftSuccess" and "jobSuccess" files, and implement a replacement

-Finish/polish the financial summary
	-Finish the code for it
	-Make it look not-awful
-Finish/polish the shifts table
	-Format TimeIn items
-Finish/polish the jobs table
	-Format StartDate items

-The better the site looks, the better the UX will be.  Friends will help, but we don't want them to begrudge it.

-Go through your project directory and delete anything you're no longer using

-Make loginFailure more than just "404 page goes here"
