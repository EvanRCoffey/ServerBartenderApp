PRE-PRESENTATION STUFF:

	MILLS

		-Implement the design/UI pass
		-Debugging and presentation prep

	EVAN

		-Finish the Timeline Creator 
			-Mills said he'd take a look at amcharts and see if it'd be quick to implement.  If not, just make something from scratch.
		-Help with debugging, design, and UI work
			-Goal checker still needs a touchup (materialize card tabs aren't working)

	EITHER/BOTH

		-Add testing to project???
		-Rehearse presentation together using online version of site
		-(Have a backup offline version ready on a flash drive?!)

POST-PRESENTAITON STUFF:

	-Quiz maker stuff:
		-"Start quiz maker" button not pulling job ID correctly.  It all seems to hinge on line 13 in quizMaker.js.
		-Change quiz answer buttons to checkboxes plus a submit button - ALL answers must match for a correct result, not just one
		-Looks like all items are marked secret right now in the menu builder
		-Prevent duplicate answers and duplicate questions

	-Flash card stuff:
		-Make all checkboxes for "selected categories" (later)
		-Make the button reference all of the checkboxes correctly (later)
		-Entrees, sides, and desserts should include allergy violations, descriptors, ingredients, too (later)
		-Job/menu should be selected instead of hardcoded, just like with the quiz maker

	-Users shouldn't delete shifts, jobs or menus.  They should "delete" them.
	  	1) Add an extra level of validation to each delete button.  On job deletion, also explain that its shifts will go, too.
	 	2) When something is "deleted", just change its "deletedByUser" flag to true.  (When a user "deletes" a job, be sure to cascade to include all of that job's shifts' "deletedByUser" flags, as well.)
	 	3) Add something to all job/shift/menu queries along the lines of "{where: {deletedByUser: false}}"
