EVAN

-Finish/polish the financial summary
	-Once Mills makes the spreadsheet, input all of the fake shift data using a dummy account
	-Debug (you can start this process now, but having the spreadsheet would help a lot)
	-Once it's all working, ship it to Mills to make it look nice
	-Once it looks nice, update the site and send the dummy account info to all users

-See if Sarah can get a bunch of data for you since she's admin at Fleming's.  It's legal if you take out all identifiers
-Decide on the JSON structure for the menus - see the back of the descriptions/ingredients page
